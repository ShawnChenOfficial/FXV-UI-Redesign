# FXV UI Redesign

This repository contains assignment materials from my Human Computing Interaction interface project.

During my last of study at the Southern Institute of Technology, I was tasked with reviewing a Web application interface design, and redesigning based on the analysis of drawbacks of its current design. 

After the analysis of its current system, there were many issues including:
1. Unclear navigation flow which result in user do not understand how to manipulate with the system.
2. Incorrect primary action of elements on pages which confusing users.
3. Insufficient information on pages.

The subsequent design adjusted the focus of those aspects, and client were more satisfied.

This repository contains 2 types of files.
1. PDF documentation which explain the new design in detail.
2. UI folder contains a set of screenshots for re-design which was development by using Justinmind.
